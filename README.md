# Adopt-a-Pet-

User will take a survey, and based on their response we will match them with a pet! The absolute value of the difference between the answer of the user and each pet is compared.. The pet with the least difference overall is matched to you.

This project is not finished and needs some touch ups if you would like to contribute. 

First, the CSS is not connecting to the html files when the local server is hosted. The local images as well are not connecting, and so web links are currently being used.

Second, when the post request sent when the user hits "submit" currently makes an error. The program is unable to compare new users to the pets.

Third, we hope to add the ability for users to drop off pets into our system for future adoption. This would follow much the same format as the survey, but would require a picture and would help give more options to users. Perhaps users can be contacted when a new "best match" for them enters the system.

Lastly, the project could be scaled up by switching to a PHP/mySQL database.

Thanks for your time, enjoy the website!
